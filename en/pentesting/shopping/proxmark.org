* Proxmark

Considerations:
- The latest Proxmark hardware is the rdv 4, it would be
  also ideal to put in place of the touchpad (that I don't use in favor of
  the clit mouse) in my laptop but it costs a lot. Also it does not
  feature a double usb for power continuity, the usefulness of such a
  feature requires further investigation prior to buying.

Buying a cheap 40 â‚¬ clone is the best option for me and as a bonus this
unit also has two usb ports for power continuity

The antennas on both unit should be easy to replace with custom ones
shall that be needed
