In defense of paper
===================

These are the reasons I sometimes prefer paper over digital resources.

Reading

### Size of useful surface

With paper sheets you can fill your field of view and take advantage of
human\'s innate sense of space if you need to make connections between
parts of a difficult subject you\'re studying. Good luck doing that with
digital instruments without filling a wall with screens and emptying
your wallet.

### Eye strain

Paper is always at the same light conditions as it\'s surroundings thus
putting less eye strain on the user.

### Searching

This is not really an argument for paper, rather a half one. If you\'re
looking precisely for something it\'s way easier to find in digitally,
but if you\'re not or you\'re not looking for something textual it might
be easier to find it with physical paper. Also spatial memory can help
with the task if you\'re using paper.

### Availability

Pen and paper are extremely available and you can find them anywhere
without effort. If you have an idea and you want to jot it down or you
want to explain something to someone you can gather the materials to do
it everywhere, often free of charge.

### Freedom of expression

On paper you can do whatever you want. There is no single digital tool
that allows you the same expressivity of paper. The closest thing you
can get are graphic tables or iPads but they are nowhere near the same
experience and the have an uncomfortable feel to them, mainly due to
delays or the stroke of the pen being unnatural. Also they have to
feature palm rejection to even be considered. And the moment your hand
gets ever so slightly sweaty it sticks to the device.
