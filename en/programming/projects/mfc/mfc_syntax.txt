MFC - MiFare classic Converter syntax

Input:

MCT: - In case of sectors or keys missing, give warning and fill with 0s (fill happens at an intermediate stage, inner 
       representation should not be filled)
     - Accept only 1k (check last sector number and sector dimension)

MFD: - Accept only 1k (check file size)

  *: - Check UID

-s / --strict argument: fail on missing data

Output:

  C: - No support for continuity, export as MFD would (so we add an intermediate fill stage)

Final syntax:

mfc <input format: mfd|mct> <output format: mfd|mct|c|keys> <input filename> [output filename] [-s]
