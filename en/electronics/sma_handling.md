# Proper handling of SMA connectors

## Fastening

SMA connectors should be fastened from the hex nut and never turned to prevent wear and damage.

## Cleaning

SMA connectors should not be touched with bare hands, especially the threaded part.
This is because the fat layer on the hand changes the RF characteristics of the connector.
This matters the most in measurement where precision is required.

If touched, SMA connectors can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and paper towels.
Be careful not to overuse a paper towel because it will start shedding fibers on your connectors.

Connectors also get dirty from tiny iron filings from wear of the threading.

The internal part with the teflon isolation can be cleaned as well with paper towels and pliers.

## Instruments connectors

If an instrument is valuable and has SMA connectors, it might be worth having adapters on it's connectors.
This reduces the connection cycles and wear on the instruments connectors and transfers this to a much
cheaper and replaceable adapter.
