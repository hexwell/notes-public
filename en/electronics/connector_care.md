# Proper Handling of Connectors

## Fastening

Screw connectors (N-type, F-type, SMA, etc.) should be fastened from the hex nut and never turned (so as to have the center pin turn inside/around the one of the mating connector) to prevent wear and damage to the mating interface.
They should also be fastened with a torque wrench.

## Cleaning

Connectors should not be touched with bare hands, especially the threaded part or the center pin.
This is because the fat layer on the hand changes the RF characteristics of the connector.
This matters the most in measurement where precision is required.

If touched, connectors can be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and paper towels.
Be careful not to overuse a paper towel because it will start shedding fibers on your connectors.

Connectors also get dirty from tiny iron filings from wear of the threading.

The internal part with the teflon insulation, for example in SMA connectors, can be cleaned as well with a piece of paper towel and pliers to hold it.

## Instruments connectors

If an instrument is valuable and has connectors, it might be worth having adapters on its connectors (sacrificial connectors).
This reduces the connection cycles and wear on the instruments connectors and transfers these to a much cheaper and replaceable adapter.

## Protective Caps (Dust Caps)

It's good practice to cap every connector and port when it is not in use.

I speculate that dust caps are brightly colored to be easy to see, and to make them harder to loose, like the elastic cords with hooks used to secure stuff on vehicles.
I wonder if this is one of the actual reasons behind the colors.
