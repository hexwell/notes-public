# DC Input

I think that all electronic devices where it's reasonable (all digital electronics with reasonably low power consumption; basically not on high-power appliances) should have a DC input with a simple voltage & current rating, that allows to power/charge them directly via DC, without complex negotiation protocols or standards.
This does not by any means discourage the devices from having any number of those other ports (USB PD, QC, etc.).
It serves only to provide the device with the simplest possible power supply, in addition to other more complex ports, and retain the largest possible compatibility even when/where standardized cables are not available.
