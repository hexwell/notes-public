"In landline telephones, bells or ringtones are rung by impressing a 60
to 105-volt RMS 20-Hertz sine wave across the tip and ring conductors of
the subscriber line, in series with the (typically) âˆ’48 VDC loop supply.
This signal is produced by a ringing generator at the central office." -

This information must be verified to be true in Italian systems as well.

Considerations: - I need the components to build this project. When I
have a successful design i might consider buying them

- I also need a design for this project

- I need a scope to debug the circuit and the design. I also need a
  frequency generator to test the working of the ringer in the phone. I
  might use the university's tools.
