* LF radio OOK receiver

This is the receiver i plan to use with my [[file:tx.md][transmitter]]

As soon as the transmitter frequency is determined I should be able to
build this receiver.

The design might be inspired by:

The circuit shown in "youtube 2" (ANT -||- N -|<- GND, N ->|- OUT -||-
GND) is just a rectifier to harvest the maximum power out of RF
(whatever frequency) but it actually loses some of the signal via the
diodes (best case .7 V with germanium diodes). I am becoming convinced
that it is not useful for this project and the design of "youtube 1" is
basically all that I need.
