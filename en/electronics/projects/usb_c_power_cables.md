# USB C PD All The Things!

Using cheap USB PD sinks from AliExpress it is possible to add USB C to a lot of old appliances. I plan to add it by cutting a hole in the chassis of the device at hand and using hot glue to secure the board in the device

I plan on adding a USB C connector to:
- My Brother PTOUCH labeler
- Using a PD Trigger in order to supply my TS-80 soldering iron with sufficient power from a USB PD source instead of the Quickcharge 3.0 that it uses

I ordered a fixed 9 V sink and a variable one with a USB A port. For the first project I plan to use the fixed module, for the TS-80 I plan to use the USB A one with a standard USB A to USB C cable. It would be probably nice to isolate the latter sink that I plan to handle and keep out of enclosure with heat shrink tube.
