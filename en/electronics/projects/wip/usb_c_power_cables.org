* Power meter

Using cheap USB PD sinks from AliExpress it is possible to create power
cords for lot of old appliances that use a barrel jack connector.

I plan on making:

- A modified 9 V battery with USB C on the bottom to use with component
  tester.
- A USB-C to 9 V barrel jack cable (negative inside) to power labeler

I ordered 3 sinks. 2 fixed 9 V sinks, and a variable one. For both of
these projects I plan to use the fixed modules.

** Battery

I already have the battery tore down. When I receive the USB sink I can
proceed to assemble the final product. Hot glue should be fine for
structure. Two wires will then connect the sink to the battery terminals.

** Cable

I plan to recycle the barrel jack to 9 V battery adapter I have. Probably
the whole thing can be made by just cutting the adapter and soldering the
wires of the barrel jack directly on the sink board, sealing everything
with heat shrink tube
