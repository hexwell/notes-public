LF radio OOK receiver
=====================

This is the receiver i plan to use with my [transmitter](tx.md)

As soon as the transmitter frequency is determined I should be able to
build this receiver.

The design might be inspired by:

Notes on these designs
----------------------

The circuit shown in \"youtube 2\" (ANT -\|\|- N -\|\<- GND, N -\>\|-
OUT -\|\|- GND) is just a rectifier to harvest the maximum power out of
RF (whatever frequency) but it actually loses some of the signal via the
diodes (best case .7 V with germanium diodes). I am becoming convinced
that it is not useful for this project and the design of \"youtube 1\"
is basically all that I need.
