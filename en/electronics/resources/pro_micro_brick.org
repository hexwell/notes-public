Arduino Pro Micros can get bricked from time to time. To unbrick:

- Open blank sketch on Arduino IDE
- Connect RST and GND pins. The device should reboot and appear to the
  OS under a different port
- Select the new port in Arduino IDE
- If it fails to upload launch the upload again and quickly reset the
  Arduino before the upload starts. If your having problems with this
  try to reset the board and quickly upload instead.
- After a second the board should appear to the OS on it's original
  port. Try to upload the sketch there. If it upload your board is
  unbricked.
