# Spectrum Analyzer

## Operating principle

A spectrum analyzer operates on the heterodyne receiver principle.
Basically a sweeping LO is mixed with the input signal, filtered narrowly and
measured in amplitude at each point of the LO sweep.

Optionally the LO output is also exposed to the user as the tracking generator output.
