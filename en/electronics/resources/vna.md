# Vector Network Analyzer

A VNA is able to measure amplitude (magnitude) of the reflected signal from the DUT (return loss / VSWR),
as well as the signal passing through the DUT (forward transmission).


## Calibration

Calibration must be done at the terminal interface between the instrument and the DUT,
at the point nearest to the DUT (calibration plane).
Calibration is done through the use of calibrations standards.


## Smith Chart

The facts about the Smith Chart are:

- left - short circuit
- center - 50Î© - center
- right - open circuit - right
- horizontal axis - resistive load
- upper part - inductive load
- lower part - capacitive load


## VNA vs Spectrum Analyzer

A VNA measures amplitude and phase, a spectrum analyzer only measures amplitude.
