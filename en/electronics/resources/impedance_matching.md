# Impedance Matching

A very nice physical demonstration of impedance mismatch/matching and reflected power is given by Steve Mould on YouTube

## Mechanical analogy

It's also nice to see that in the video impedance is matched using a lever, and the [Electrical-Mechanical analogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical%E2%80%93electrical_analogies) depict a **transformer**, that is often used to match impedance, as the equivalent of the **lever**.
