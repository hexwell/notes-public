Multimeters
===========

Multimeters can have, ranked by importance:

Must have:

-   Voltage measuring
-   Current measuring
-   Resistance measuring
-   Continuity testing

Very useful:

-   Capacitance measuring

Nice additions:

-   Auto range
-   Min/Max functions for voltage, current and frequency
-   Frequency counting
-   Inductance measuring

Rarely used:

-   Transistor gain measuring

The ranking rationale of the first items is obvious, the last ones are
there because for inductance the methods referred to in the \[measuring
inductance link\] can be used and very few meters have the setting and
for transistor testing a component tester is often easier, more
practical and gives nicer more complete results (although it\'s better
to refer to the component\'s datasheet for higher accuracy)
