* Oscilloscopes

Considerations: - Oscilloscopes can reliably measure signals up to 1/5
of their rated frequency

Expensive scope: Siglent SDS1202X-E

It is a good compromise between money and functionality, giving me the
ability to do basic analysis of signals up to 1 MHz directly at home
without using the university's equipment. It has been tested by
DiodeGoneWild [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCI0S3Bcofc&t=5s][in
this youtube video]]. This model is the only one of it's kind that had
it's background checked. It is distinguished from the others by the
interface and keypad equal to those seen in the video.
