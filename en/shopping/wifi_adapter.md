# WiFi Adapter Considerations

I want a WiFi 6E adapter for my laptop.
The features I want are 160 MHz-wide channels (from 802.11ac) and 6 GHz channels (802.11ax / WiFi 6).

Contextually to this I took the occasion to explore 802.11 standards.

Below I report a breakdown of frequencies used by 802.11 standards and the standards that define them.

Relevant WiFi Standards:
a, b, g, n, ac, ad, ax, af, ah, aj, ay

Frequencies:
  2.4 GHz (1997, b, g, n, ac, ax)
900   Mhz (1997)
  5   GHz (a, n, ac, ax)
 60   GHz (ad, ay)
  6   GHz (ax)
(White Spaces) 54 -
790   MHz (af)
Sub -
  1   GHz (ah)
 45   GHz (aj)

The extremely popular ones are 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, with 6 GHz being appended by 802.11ax to the 5 GHz band.
The other ones (White Spaces, 45/60 GHz and Sub-1 GHz) are less diffused and have been designed with other uses cases
(not really consumer laptops) in mind.

Having done these considerations, and having decided that access to the lesser used standards is not of huge interest to me,
the Intel AX210 seems a good choice, since it provides the features I wanted.

It also seems like it would be a relatively future-proof choice, as planned upcoming standards would not require me to upgrade.

Another candidate considered at first was the Intel AX200, but it does not have 6GHz channels.
