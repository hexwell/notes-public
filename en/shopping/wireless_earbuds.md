# Wireless Earbuds

## Reasons not to buy them:

- Having to charge them
- Latency of BT audio
- Expensiveness (think of having to replace them in case of loss)
- Bulkyness
- Complex system for a very simple task, also cabled headphones can be repurposed and used in a lot of scenarios compared to wireless ones
