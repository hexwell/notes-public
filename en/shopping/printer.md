# Printer considerations

I have been looking for a printer.

My requirements are:

- color
- Lowest maintenance possible
- Lowest bullshit possible (non self-replaceable parts, annoying show stoppers, having to send to the device to the manufacturer, etc.)
- Very low volume requirements. Circa 1 print per week, with peaks of 30 prints per day and valleys of no print for a month.
- As physically little as possible


## Candidates

Candidates in order of likelihood of purchase:

- Canon 5051 - 150€
- Laser printers (Brother, ..?)
- Epson EcoTank, various models


## Candidate rundown

### Canon 5051

This has been recommended to me by a local dealer. So far it's the best option as it has a good balance of maintenance required, hassles and cost.

#### Pros

- Little upfront cost
- Can go 1 month without printing

#### Cons
- Expensive Supplies (40€ each)


### Laser printers

These would give absolutely 0 problems, but they are very bulky and expensive.

#### Pros

- No problems whatsoever, fits every need

#### Cons

- Very expensive upfront
- Very expensive supplies
- Bulky


### Epson EcoTanks

I really like the idea and cost of these, but they have tons of problems.

#### Pros

- Nice design
- Cheap supplies

#### Cons

- High upfront cost
- Polluted with bullshit (the cleaning pad needs to be replaced by Epson for firmware reset, with no official alternative. It is possible to reset the firmware with dubious 3rd party software)
- Max 2 days without printing
- Maintenance prints are often required
