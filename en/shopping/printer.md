# Printer considerations

I have been looking for a printer.

My requirements are:

- Color
- Lowest maintenance possible
- Lowest bullshit possible (non self-replaceable parts, annoying show stoppers, having to send to the device to the manufacturer, etc.)
- Very low volume requirements. Circa 1 print per week, with peaks of 30 prints per day and valleys of no print for a month.
- As physically little as possible
- ADF (not absolutely necessary, but would be nice to have)

## Laser Printers

Laser printers would be a great fit for the job, but all the model I have available are very very bulky and expensive.
Furthermore, they are not the best for the home as they release fine particles in the air.

## Printers with Ink tank

The idea is wonderful, however I've read many reviews and long term concerns with these, regarding clogged tubes and other issues.
They also need to be used very frequently and maintenance prints to keep the tubes unclogged.
I think I'll give this technology a couple year more.

### EPSON EcoTanks

These seem great but unfortunately they have a few issues in addition to the ones above.
One is that the cleaning pad needs to be replaced by EPSON for firmware reset, with no official alternative. It is possible to reset the firmware with dubious 3rd party software).
This issue is probably common with other EPSON printers, but there are not a ton of alternatives.

## HP Printers

The HP printers that I had available all had a sticker saying that they take measures against unofficial cartridges.
I don't like this practice, so I decided to not consider these (even tho the other brands do it as well. At least they don't advertise it).
