## Categories

### Self Balancing Devices

Devices included in this category are:
- Self-Balancing Electric Board
- Self-Balancing Electric Rollerblades
- Self-Balancing Electric Single Wheel Board
- Self-Balancing Electric Unicycle

These devices share some common issues, in particular:

- Inability to withstand harshness of the road or riding surface. Any destabilizing feature will result in abrupt braking
  due to the way the throttle and brakes are controlled (gyroscope), but being the board at ground level (and thus the
  braking happening at ground level) with only the legs and muscle power of the user to convey the deceleration to the
  majority of the mass of the moving body, this will often result in the user being catapulted by inertia on the road
  ahead. Most self balancing devices lack this way for the user to dissipate inertia and transfer momentum to the ground,
  but this can be mitigated with user skill.


### Small-Wheeled Devices

Devices included in this cathegory are:
- Electric Scooter
- Electric Skateboard
- Electric Rollerblades

These devices share some common issues, in particular:

- The size of the potholes and harshness that a vehicle can tackle is directly related to the size of its wheels. Devices
  with small wheels are really unfit to any surface that is not considerably smooth. This makes them not suitable for daily use.


## Devices Rundown

In this section the features that are specific to each device are highlighted.

### Electric Bicycle

One of the best devices. Has great versatility and can do whatever a normal bike can do. Can be fitted with tons of batteries and
have powerful motors. Can be used as a daily driver both in urban and off road paths.

Pros:
- Great versatility
- Good range
- Hight speed & power
- Capable of withstanding harsh tracks
- Ability to run "manually" on leg power

Cons:
- Not usable on all roads (no high-speed roads)


### Electric Car

Has great potential for substituting normal cars, especially for most people and for everyday needs.

Pros:
- High speed
- Low noise
- No direct emissions

Cons:
- Small range compared to ICE cars
- Too much driver assistance (not inherent, idiosyncratic to current models)
- Too little control to the user (not inherent, idiosyncratic to current models)
- Too slow to charge compared to ICE cars


### Electric Motorcycle

Similar to electric bike, with these differences:

Pros:
- Usable on all roads (high-speed roads)

Cons:
- Too slow to charge compared to ICE motorcycles
- Not able to run "manually" on leg power


### Self-Balancing Electric Board

Although this suffers from the self-balancing devices illnesses, and is unsuited for road use, it is very fun to use indoor,
where its agility is greatly appreciated. The way they are controlled is quite natural and it feels like an extension of the body,
as every good technology/tool should.

### Self-Balancing Electric Single Wheel Board

Although this suffers from the self-balancing devices illnesses, it might still be worth getting for leisure.
