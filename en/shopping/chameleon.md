# Chameleon

The Proxgrind ChameleonTiny is very nice as it is portable and features USB C, but it is expensive and less versatile than other versions.

Both the Proxgrind ChameleonMini Rev. G and the Kasper Oswald ChameleonMini Rev. G are more versatile with custom antenna support via u.FL connector or direct connection. They are less expensive as well. Buying is an option but borrowing from friends upon need is an option too.
