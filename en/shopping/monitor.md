# Monitor (screen) shopping considerations

My requirements for a monitor are:

- Opaque/matte/non-reflective
- FHD+
- Smallest possible bezels
- Relatively cheap
- 22" - 24", I later decided for 24", but I left the 22" considerations for the future
- HDMI Input

Nice to have:
- Audio output
- Black

Considered but deemed not necessary:
- USB-C input
	- Internal hub with USB-A ports


I ended up buying a D24-20 that I found from a local dealer
It is very similar to the L24e-20 except for the design of the back, which is a bit worse,
with the cross section of the back bulge appearing as a box instead of a trapezoid, and the colored logo.
I decided to overlook these differences because the monitor was mainly for my parents to use and it would not make a difference to them.


## Candidates

### Lenovo

22"
- L22e-20
- T23d-10

24"
- L24e-20
- T24d-10

### HP

I only looked at 22" monitors from HP, since I found them expensive and I was satisfied with the Lenovo options.

- P224

The considerations for these two are the same done for the 22" models.
