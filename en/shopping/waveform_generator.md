# Waveform generator considerations

## Introduction
Target: Function/signal/waveform generator. Ideally 0-30 MHz or better.
<br>
I think  30 MHz will suffice for me for the following reasons:
- I can upconvert signals up to 4 GHz with a mixer and an oscillator that I own, and get other for ever higher frequencies, so this bandwidth is more relevant as far as modulation or sweep is concerned rather than actual final frequency of the signal
- I can use a NanoVNA that I own to cover the rest of the test cases that I foresee I might encounter

## Glossary

- FRA = Frequency Response Analysis, used interchangeably with Bode Plot

## Brands

- Keysight (very expensive)
- UNI-T (too expensive for the brand, interface not great, UTG962E is kinda cool tho)
- Rigol (too expensive for the brand, interface & design not great)
- Siglent
- Tektronix (very expensive)
- Rhode & Schwarz (extremely expensive & above spec)
- Teledyne LeCroy (lower end products are Siglent rebrands)
- OWON (too expensive for brand, low quality)
- GW Instek

## Models

### Siglent SDG1032X

Pros:
- Very good interface
- Very good software support
- Compatible with Siglent SDS1104X-E for FRA
