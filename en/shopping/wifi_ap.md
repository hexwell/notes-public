# Ubiquiti Wireless Access Points considerations

Ubiquiti Networks wireless access points rundown summary

## Introduction

Target: SOHO wireless access point

## Brands

I considered just Ubiquity Networks because they're the one with the best price/quality ratio, excluding all consumer-grade manufacturers that I want to avoid, as they don't allow the kind of customization and control I want over my network equipment

## Models

In target models:

- AP HD (way overkill, the support for a lot of clients is not needed)
- AP SHD (inherits from AP HD, also security radio is questionable and not really needed)
- AP AC Lite
- AP AC PRO (a bit overkill, the AP AC Lite will do just fine for normal use. In case we look for a bit more "pro" device this used to be great, but is now superseded by the nanoHD)
- AP AC LR (long range not needed)
- AP XG (same as AP HD and even more overkill)
- nanoHD
- Flex HD

## AP AC Lite

These are the perfect fit for home usage

## Flex HD, nanoHD

These APs have basically the same specs (and I suspect HW) and are very nice. Nothing to say, this is the way to go if you want something a bit more pro (and also a tiny bit overkill)
