- Good software support


Mandatory:
	HW:

		- Proximity sensor (phone calls & pocket avoidance)
		- NFC
		- Metal/plastic body
		- GPS
		- USB type C

	SW:
		- Screen off while proximity during phone calls


Better to have:
	HW:

		- Compass (better navigation)
		- Rear fingerprint reader
		- USB 3.1
		- USB PD
		- Notification led (very useful)
		- OLED screen
		- WiFi 5

	SW:

		- Double tap to wake
